    <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>

    <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>

      <p>
        Neuroplasticity, also known as brain plasticity, describes the brain's
        capacity to restructure itself by creating new neural pathways. This
        capability enables neurons (the brain's nerve cells) to adapt to
        injuries and new circumstances, thereby adjusting their functions
        accordingly. Here are some ways we can increase or harness
        Neuroplasticity:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Engage in activities that challenge your brain regularly, e.g learning
          a new instrument or taking up a new sport.
        </li>
        <li>
          Embrace lifelong learning and seek out novel experiences that
          stimulate your brain.
        </li>
        <li>Regular exercise has been shown to enhance neuroplasticity.</li>
        <li>
          Quality sleep is crucial for brain health and facilitates neural
          repair and growth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Interacting with others stimulates cognitive function and can support
          brain health.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here is come good content around neuroplasticity that I have read/watched in the past.<br />Dr Joe Dispenza talks to Jay Shetty in this podcast and also has a series of books on changing brain chemistry, this one is my favourite!</p>

    <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
    <div style="color: white">
    <p>
      Growth mindset refers to the belief that abilities and intelligence can be
      developed through dedication and hard work. Individuals with a growth
      mindset embrace challenges and view effort as a path to mastery. This is
      quite the opposite of fixed mindset (close minded), where abilities are
      seen as “what you’re born with” and unchangeable.<br /><br />Growth mindset is
      relevant because it fosters resilience, learning, and personal
      development. In educational and professional settings, holding a growth
      mindset can lead to greater achievement and fulfilment. Throughout my
      learning journey at DevAcademy I will definitely need to incorporate a
      growth mindset. Each day I will have to struggle with challenges and view
      them as opportunities to grow , set realistic goals and work towards them,
      seek feedback and respond to it.
