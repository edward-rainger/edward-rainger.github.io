    <h1>Foundations Reflections</h1>
    <h2>
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the Human Skills learning?
    </h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
       <li>I need to become more in touch with the person I want to be. In the past I have become very good at adapting and becoming the person that fits in the current situation right, and therefore not holding true to any values or beliefs I may have. </li>
       <li>I've learnt that more about effective communication, including listening, empathy, and clarity in expression. As I delve into these areas, Ive started to discover certain patterns or habits that stem from my ego, such as a tendency to dominate conversations, interrupt others, or avoid vulnerable discussions. </li>
       <li>I think the main thing I've learnt is that human skills along with everything in life encourage constant self reflection, and the more you can keep note of what works and what doesn't the better equipped to handle the same situations moving forwward. </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Self-awareness helps programmers recognize their strengths, weaknesses,
      and biases. This awareness allows them to continuously improve their
      skills and decision-making processes.<br /><br />
      Values and ethics determine how programmers may approach things such as
      privacy, security, and the impact of technology on society.<br /><br />
      Empathy helps programmers understand the needs and perspectives of users.
      This is crucial for developing code that meets real-world needs
      effectively. It also fosters effective teamwork by promoting respect among
      colleagues. It helps in resolving conflicts and encourages a positive work
      environment.
    </p>
    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h2>
    <p>Not a whole lot to be fair, as in the past I have always been very into the brain, EQ etc, so nothing surprised me however they helped reinstate my need for work in many areas which will never have an end goal but hopefully a constant continuum.</p>
    <h2>
      What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
    </h2>
    <p>
      For myself the most challenging part of the Human Skills learning was the
      self reflection work rather than studying topics such as
      'Neuroplasticity', this is probably because I read and listen to a
      lot of topics on the brain but often don't take the time put into motion
      the things I've learnt. I often find it difficult to talk about myself, my
      future, my values etc because I have probably put off reflecting on it in
      the past.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now that I've finished Foundations I believe a big part of the Human
      Skills implementation is due to the mental game of learning to code, it
      can be frustrating and seem like you're getting nowhere at times. If you
      can 'learn how to learn', and learn how to cope with negative feelings
      arising it goes a long way to getting what you want done.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
      waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
      instead? Justify your answer.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At times during the course this thought did pop into my head however,
      theres a few reasons why I brushed it off. One is that sometimes it was
      nice to break up the tasks with a bit of social reflection and not just
      thinking in terms of code. Two, the human skills part never took very
      long, an hour max here and there didn't upset the workflow. And finally it
      was nice to have the blog structure in a way that sort of had two halves
      to it. For example each sprint reflected back from the Tech that week and
      sort of alligned with the Human Skill of the week.
