    <h1>Javascript and the DOM</h1>
    <h2>
      An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the realm of web development, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS form the
      fundamental trio that collaborates to create websites. Im going to compare
      their relationship to that of a chef, ingredients, and presentation.<br /><br />

      JavaScript serves as the creative force behind web interactivity, much
      like a chef in a kitchen. It adds functionality and dynamism to web pages,
      handling tasks such as form validation, interactive features, animations,
      and more, making websites responsive and engaging for users.<br /><br />

      HTML (HyperText Markup Language) acts as the foundational "ingredients" in
      web development, similar to basic components in cooking recipes. It
      provides the structure and content of web pages, defining elements such as
      headings, paragraphs, images, and links. HTML ensures content is
      structured logically and accessible to users and search engines, laying
      the groundwork for JavaScript and CSS enhancements.<br /><br />

      CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) enhances the visual presentation of HTML
      elements on web pages, akin to the art of presenting a dish. Like a chef's
      plating skills, CSS defines aesthetic aspects such as colours, fonts,
      layouts, and animations, ensuring websites not only function well but also
      look visually appealing.<br /><br />
    </p>
    <h2>
      Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
      life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).
    </h2>
    <p>
      Control flow in programming dictates the sequence in which instructions or
      statements are executed, similarly when making a cup of coffee you follow
      a series of steps: boiling water, grinding coffee beans etc. Each step
      must be executed in a specific order to achieve the desired outcome.<br /><br />

      Loops in programming serve a role of repeating a block of code until a
      particular condition is satisfied. The process of stirring a cup coffee is
      a repetitive action that ensures even distribution. In programming, a loop
      would be analogous to stirring – it continues the action until the coffee
      is perfectly blended (condition satisfied).<br /><br />
    </p>
    <h2>
      Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
    </h2>
    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) in web development is like a digital web family tree. Each element on a web page, such as instructions, images, or buttons, corresponds to a step in the web development process.<br><br>
      Interacting with the DOM is essentially customising.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Accessing Elements: You can select elements in the DOM using methods like document.getElementById() or document.querySelector(). These methods allow you to find specific elements based on their IDs, classes, or tag names.</li>
        <li>Modifying Content: Once you have selected an element, you can change its content, style, or attributes using properties and methods provided by the DOM.</li>
        <li>Handling Events: You can respond to user actions (like clicks or key presses) by adding event listeners to DOM elements. Event listeners allow you to specify JavaScript code to run when an event occurs.</li>
        <li>Creating and Manipulating Elements: You can dynamically create new elements and add them to the DOM, or remove existing elements.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>
      Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Arrays are lists of items where each item is indexed numerically, starting
      from 0. To access data from an array, you use square brackets [ ] with the
      index number, to get the first item. Arrays are used for storing
      collections of similar data that you want to access by their position in
      the list.
      <br /><br />
      On the other hand, objects are collections of key-value pairs, where each
      key (or property) is unique and has a value. You can access data from an
      object using dot notation (.) if you know the exact property name or
      square brackets [ ] if the property name is dynamic. Objects are useful
      for storing data that needs descriptive labels, allowing you to retrieve
      values based on these labels rather than numerical indices.
    </p>
    <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h2>
    <p>
      Functions in JavaScript are like recipes you create to perform specific
      tasks in your code. Imagine you have a set of steps to make something.
      Instead of rewriting those steps each time you want a sandwich, you write
      them down once as a recipe (function). This way, you can make as many
      sandwiches (perform tasks) as you need just by following the recipe
      (calling the function). Functions help keep your code organized and easier
      to understand. They allow you to break down your program into smaller,
      manageable parts. For example, you can have one function to calculate a
      number, another to display something and so on. This makes your code more
      reusable because you can use the same function multiple times without
      writing the same code again.
