    <h1>Emotional Intelligence (EQ)</h1>
    <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
    <p>
      Emotional intelligence also referred to as emotional quotient (EQ), is the
      ability to <u>recognize</u>, <u>understand</u>, <u>manage</u>, and
      effectively <u>express</u> one's own emotions, as well as the ability to
      <u>perceive</u>, <u>interpret</u>, and <u>respond</u> to the emotions of
      others.<br /><br />It involves a set of skills that enable us to navigate
      social interactions, manage relationships, and make decisions based on
      emotional awareness and empathy.<br /><br />The set of skills include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Self-awareness: The ability to recognise and understand one's own
        emotions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Self-regulation: The capacity to manage and control one's emotional
        reactions, impulses, and behaviours, even in stressful or challenging
        situations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Motivation: The drive to pursue goals with energy and persistence,
        despite setbacks, and the ability to delay gratification for long-term
        rewards.
      </li>
      <li>
        Empathy: The skill of understanding and considering others' emotions,
        feelings, and perspectives, which facilitates effective communication
        and relationship-building.
      </li>
      <li>
        Social skills: The ability to manage and navigate social interactions,
        communicate effectively, influence others positively, and resolve
        conflicts constructively.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
    <p>
      Emotional Intelligence (EQ) and Intelligence Quotient (IQ) are two aspects
      of human intelligence.<br /><br />IQ evaluates cognitive skills like
      logical thinking, problem-solving, and language abilities, crucial for
      academic and analytical tasks, contributing to academic and career
      success.<br /><br />
      In contrast, EQ encompasses emotional and social abilities essential for
      managing emotions, building relationships, and navigating social
      situations effectively. Skills such as self-awareness, self-control,
      empathy, and interpersonal communication are pivotal for personal
      well-being and effective leadership.<br /><br />
      Both EQ and IQ complement each other in personal and professional
      achievement. Integrating emotional intelligence with cognitive skills
      improves decision-making, enhances teamwork, and facilitates clear
      communication. Recognising the significance of both enables a well-rounded
      approach to growth.
    </p>
    <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
    <p>
      Emotional intelligence is essential in various aspects of life, including
      personal relationships, leadership, teamwork, and professional success. It
      enables individuals to build stronger connections with others, make
      informed decisions based on emotional insights, and adapt to diverse
      social and cultural environments. Developing emotional intelligence
      involves self-reflection, practice, and learning from experiences. It can
      be cultivated through training, coaching, and mindfulness practices that
      enhance emotional awareness and regulation skills. Understanding and
      applying emotional intelligence can lead to improved communication,
      enhanced interpersonal relationships, better stress management, and
      overall well-being.
