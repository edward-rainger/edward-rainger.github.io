    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
    <h2>Reflection on problem-solving techniques:</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
        <li>Pseudocode: I can definitely see how it is helpful for planning out the structure and logic of my code before diving in and think it will be something I need to learn to use as much as possible.</li>
        <li>Trying something: I found this the most useful when wanting to hardwire a new learning as it gets hardwired when you go back through and use Google to help and explain with what you did wrong.</li>
        <li>Error messages: I need to get better at this one, I get a bit lazy with using console.log and reading errors.</li>
        <li>Googling: While I am a beginner, Ill be heavily relying on Google but hopefully start to use it for small parts of code rather than getting it to answer all my questions, which I have already seen starting to happen.</li>
        <li>Asking someone: This is still probably the last resort for me as its a bit of a barrier to overcome of not thinking that its a silly question. Work on.</li>

        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h2>
      <p>To be fair there has been a few times where I have wanted to ask for help but have figured it out using multiple websites or ChatGPT, I think if there was something I really couldnt figure out then I would or if it was specific question to a Dev Academy task. I think this will happen more during Bootcamp as it will be harder and also I will be in comms with students and facilitators a lot more.</p>
