      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </h4>
    <p>
      I think an ethical decision I make each day is to be honest. Due to some
      troubles with addiction I havenâ€™t always told the truth and it makes it
      very hard for people to trust you going forward. It becomes a habit and a
      lot of the time you start to believe your own lies. When you make the
      decision to tell the truth, a few things happen, you feel better even if
      the truth hurts, other people will rely on you more often and you wont
      have to build off that lie. The values of integrity and responsibility
      will always give you a long term gain vs a short term fix.

      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning

    <p>
      One of my key strengths is adaptability. I thrive in new environments and
      quickly adjust to new challenges and technologies. This will be help
      during my learning journey as I am brand new to tech and understand that
      is an evolving industry. Additionally, my strong problem-solving skills
      enable me to approach problems creatively. These strengths will allow me
      to navigate uncertainties and hopefully contribute to constant growth.

      >Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h7
    >
    <p>
      While I enjoy a hands-on learning environment, I sometimes struggle with
      maintaining focus on repetitive tasks. This could potentially affect my
      learning journey by requiring me to implement strategies like breaking
      tasks into smaller steps or varying study methods to stay engaged.
      Additionally, my perfectionism tendencies might occasionally lead to
      spending excessive time on details rather than focusing on broader
      learning objectives.
