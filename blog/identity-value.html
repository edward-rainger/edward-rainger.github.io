    <h1>Identity, Values, Strengths</h1>

    <h2>
      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision.<br /><br />Discuss
      how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </h2>

    <p>
      I think an ethical decision I make each day is to be honest. Due to some
      troubles with addiction I haven’t always told the truth and it makes it
      very hard for people to trust you going forward. It becomes a habit and a
      lot of the time you start to believe your own lies. When you make the
      decision to tell the truth, a few things happen, you feel better even if
      the truth hurts, other people will rely on you more often and you wont
      have to build off that lie. The values of integrity and responsibility
      will always give you a long term gain vs a short term fix.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Growing up in a split-parent household with limited contact with my father
      and being surrounded by four sisters, my upbringing and the people around
      me profoundly shaped my values and identity. As a young person, I was
      naturally driven to achieve and spent a lot of time outside the house.
      However, around the age of 16, I began to rebel and became somewhat
      rebellious and neglectful of my studies. Despite these challenges, certain
      core values remained steadfast throughout my journey. Kindness, empathy,
      and the importance of making the right choices were values instilled in me
      from a young age. However they are still very much still shaping today and
      I am enjoying the EQ process of this course.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
      journey.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One of my key strengths is adaptability. I thrive in new environments and
      quickly adjust to new challenges and technologies. This will be help
      during my learning journey as I am brand new to tech and understand that
      is an evolving industry. Additionally, my strong problem-solving skills
      enable me to approach problems creatively. These strengths will allow me
      to navigate uncertainties and hopefully contribute to constant growth.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h2>
    <p>
      While I enjoy a hands-on learning environment, I sometimes struggle with
      maintaining focus on repetitive tasks. This could potentially affect my
      learning journey by requiring me to implement strategies like breaking
      tasks into smaller steps or varying study methods to stay engaged.
      Additionally, my perfectionism tendencies might occasionally lead to
      spending excessive time on details rather than focusing on broader
      learning objectives.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension.<br /><br />Discuss strategies you
      tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
      other strategies you would try now and why.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While fundraising for Movember one year, there was conflicting ideas on
      fundraising strategies which led to tension among my friends. Initially,
      we tried to discuss and compromise, but egos came out. Looking back, I see
      that setting clear goals and expectations upfront, rather than during a
      project, would have prevented this from happening.
