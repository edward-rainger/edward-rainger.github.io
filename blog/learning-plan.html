    <h1>Learning<br />Plan</h1>
    <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    <p>
      I would say my long term goal or career pathway is relatively broad right
      now. Im interested in a wide range of industries. I have experience in
      some which are completely different such as construction and graphic
      design. However I am starting to try and gain skills currently in design,
      tech and marketing, hopefully I can start to formulate a path forward with
      some hard skills added to the resume.
    </p>
    <h2>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have a hard time learning consistently due to ADHD and work better under
      time constraints, pressure, competition etc. This means that I am normally
      last minute with my progress, (cramming). This is something I want to
      improve on. My strengths would be doing rather than just listening or
      watching which I imagine is similar for most people. Figuring things out
      as I go.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I would like to enhance my skills in effective communications, time
      management and building resilience and managing stress during challenging
      periods.
    </p>
    <h2>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This
      should include:<br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
          and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
          representatives.
        </li>
        <li>
          What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
          you.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </h2>
    <p>
      I commit to achieving consistently along the learning process by seeking
      help through questions when needed and regularly checking in on Discord.
      When facing difficulties (now haha) with tricky learning components, I
      will take advantage of tutors as needed to ensure my progress.
    </p>
    <h2>
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I will seek help from Google, Discord, Chat GPT or a friend when needed.
    </p>
    <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h2>
    <p>
      I anticipate the facilitation team will assist me in comprehending task
      and inquiries, and provide support that furthers my understanding and
      learning process.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like
      school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am free for the whole period apart from one weekend which I am flying to
      Dunedin but I will work around it and it shouldn’t be a problem.
